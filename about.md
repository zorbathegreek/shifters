Biomass gasification is the key option to counteract climate change by turning atmospheric CO2 into charcoal: plants, via photosynthesis, remove excess CO2 (from oil, coal, gas, ...) from the atmosphere, and biomass gasification prepares it for sequestering in agriculture as a long term carbon sink.
