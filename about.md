Biomass gasification is one of the key options to counteract climate change by turning atmospheric CO2 into charcoal.  Plants, via photosynthesis, remove excess CO2 (from oil, coal, gas, ...) from the atmosphere, and gasification prepares it for sequestering in agriculture as a long term carbon sink. More info about gasification is [here](link.com), [here](link.com), and [here](link.com). [Here](link.com) is the organizational structure of our informal international organization.

Organic carbon from biomass is turned into bio/physiologically inert charcoal and [sequestered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) in agriculture, using the soil as a [carbon sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink).
