Biomass gasification is one of the key options to reduce atmospheric CO2 and counteract climate change because it immobilizes carbon: plants, via photosynthesis, remove excess CO2 (from oil, coal, gas, ...) from the atmosphere and gasification prepares it for sequestering in agriculture. More info about gasification is [here](link.com), [here](link.com), and [here](link.com). [Here](link.com) is the organizational structure of our informal international organization.

Organic carbon from biomass is turned into bio/physiologically inert charcoal and [sequestered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) in agriculture, using the soil as a [carbon sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink).
