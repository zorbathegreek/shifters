Biomass gasification is one of the key options to fight climate change. Organic carbon from biomass is turned into bio/physiologically inert charcoal and [sequestered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration) in agriculture, using the soil as a [carbon sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink). The carbon sources oil, gas and coal, through human influence, end up as CO2 in the atmosphere; plants remove it from the atmosphere via photosynthesis, and gasification of biomass immobilizes the carbon! You can find out more about gasification [here](link.com), [here](link.com), and [here](link.com). [Here](link.com) is the organizational structure of our informal international organization.
